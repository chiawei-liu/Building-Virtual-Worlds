# Building Virtual Worlds

This repo is only intended to archive and showcase the codes I wrote in [Building Virtual Worlds](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/learn/curriculum/building-virtual-worlds/), a course at [CMU ETC](https://www.etc.cmu.edu/), Fall 2021.

This repo doesn't contain the full projects and are not supposed to be runnable independently because I only excerpted the script files that I did mostly. Nonetheless, the codes in Round 5 were more intertwined since we modified each other's code interchangeably, so I'd like to credit my partner [Tanvi Ganu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanviganu/).

Final playthrough videos and more info about each project are available below:
